CFLAGS = -Wall -Werror -Wextra

gcc $(CFLAGS) -D BUFFER_SIZE=42 get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c main.c?

Do I need to share the fd argument using open? like with the tester?

Read the file line by line.
Use the BUFFER_SIZE to determinate how many 

fd = open()



Goal: Write a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor

Process:

READ loop
    - READ part
    - Loop reading until NULL char
    - Adding each new part for a string
    - Return the string

GNL
    - Create a static var: keep the limit 
    - While the read
    - Return
        - READ the buffer size
        - NULL

Main
    - Open the file in the main

H file
    - Define the buffer size
